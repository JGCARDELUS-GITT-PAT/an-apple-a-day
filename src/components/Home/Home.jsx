					<CardText>
						We are a company that charges insane prices for pretty
						awesome tech, so maybe it's justified. We are very
						concerned with the ecosystem, that's why we don't
						include chargers nor earphones with our phones (but we
						change the charger port each year so you still need to
						buy a new charger). What else... Let us think, Â¡Aha!
						While we do care about environment, we don't care so
						much for the workers in the factories, they have it
						pretty bad. Our software is awesome though, and we have
						this ecosystem that ties everything toghether. Our
						products work seamlessly with one another, no one else
						can do that. The ecosystem also has a nice side-effect,
						once in you cannot get out.

									This our money cow if you wish. People
									cannot seem to stop buying the iPhone even
									though we just change the corners from
									round, to square and back again to round.
									It's amazing. We also create things that
									just work with iPhone (you now, for that
									ecosystem lock). Those things were not
									necessary in the first place, so we forced
									it a little bit. For example, remember the
									Jack 3.5mm connector, we removed so we could
									sell the AirPods for an extra 150$. But, on
									the other hand, iPhone works amazingly, it's
									fast, it's cool and it gets updates more
									than any other device. AirPods, although
									expensive are really convinient and we made
									a billion market from it.

							</AccordionItem>
							<AccordionItem
								title="iPad"
								parentId="main-products"
							>
								<p>
									This is just a bigger iPhone. It was useless
									until we launched iPad OS which enabled
									people to actually utilize all the power
									available in those bad boys. Students seem
									to love it.

							<AccordionItem
								title="MacBook"
								parentId="main-products"
							>
								<p>
									This is just a bigger MacBook. No, just
									kidding. MacBooks are pretty awesome, they
									are UNIX based, which cannot be said about
									PC. This helps developers. For
									non-developers (a.k.a. muggles) it also
									brings a cohesive UI/UX experience and again
									works seamlessly with all products. This
									UI/UX cohesiviness sometimes goes too far.
									For example, we made a useless keyboard and
									an overheating computer in 2019 trying to
									make the laptop smaller. We also started
									developing our own chips in-house which has
									made Intel very mad.
								</p>
							</AccordionItem>
							<AccordionItem
								title="Apple Watch / Air Pods"
								parentId="main-products"
							>
								<p>
									This is just a smaller iPhone. Also not. The
									Apple Watch is cool but doesn't do much.
									AirPods are awesome.
