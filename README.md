Keeps your money away. This page is the follow up to a-window-into-microsoft and now it has Bootstrap!

Note: This is a satirical page. Please don't take it seriously.

## Attention

This is a React app whose components wrap Bootstrap components. To see how the Bootstrap components were utilized you can check the "main" branch, and dive into src/components/UI or, alternatively, you can check the source code of the webpage which, I think, will show more clearly the implementation. The Bootstrap components utilized in this app were:

-   Cards
-   Alerts
-   Accordions
-   Modals
-   Typography
-   Buttons
-   Tables
-   Containers, Rows & Columns

## Navigation

This page has 4 pages, but they are not different files. This is because I didn't use React Router and therefor is a one-page app. The four pages are:

1 - Home

2 - Products

3 - Store

4 - Credits

There is no required order of navigation. You can explore the webpage as you wish. There are some jokes wating to be discovered.

## Credits

Special thanks to the amazing libraries that power the site.
